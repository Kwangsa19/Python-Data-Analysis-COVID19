# Python-Data-Analysis-Covid19

> This project is based on Coursera project course. Please enroll to this course by visiting this [link](https://www.coursera.org/projects/covid19-data-analysis-using-python). In this scenario, I analyzed the COVID-19 death dataset 2020. 
> I analyzed the data by producing outputs such as: Top 5 countries with the highest death rates, average death rate, the country with the highest and lowest death rate. In addition, I also joined the two datasets: Death rate dataset 2020 and world happiness dataset 2019 and conducting linear regression between the death rate of COVID-19 against some factors that define what a happy country is. 

## Implementation

1. Find the following statistic results: 
* Top five countries with the highest death rate: <br>

* Average death rate: <br>

* The highest death rate: <br>

* The lowest death rate: <br>

* The death time series: <br>

* Death across all countries: <br>

2. The correlation between the death rate of COVID-19 against some factors that define what a happhy country is.
   In addition, to determine the correlation:
   - If R^2 is close to 1, it suggests a strong correlation.
   - If R^2 is around 0.5, it suggests a moderate correlation.
   - If R^2 is close to 0, it indicates a weak correlation.
   
* The correlation betwen GDP per capita against the death rate (Weak correlation): <br>

* The correlation betwen Social support against the death rate (Weak correlation): <br>

* The correlation betwen Healthy Life Expectancy against the death rate (Weak correlation): <br>

* The correlation betwen Freedom to make choices against the death rate (Weak correlation): <br>

## Future Works
* Fix the death across all countries chart as it looks messy on X-axis.
* Build an interface that can allow us to do the computation as required and needed.
* Add testing/normalization test for processing raw data too.
